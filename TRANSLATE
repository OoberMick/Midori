+++ Translating Midori +++

If you want to translate Midori, here are a few helpful tips.

To update the localization template:

./waf build --update-po

If you want to add a new language 'aa', create it like this:

cd po
msginit -l aa_CC -o aa.po -i midori.pot
sed -i 's/PACKAGE/midori/g' aa.po

To check your language 'aa' for errors, do this:

msgfmt -c --check-accelerators=_ aa.po

To test your changes, make sure you install Midori:

./waf install

And of course you can uninstall it again after testing:

./waf uninstall

To run Midori in a particular language, run it like this:

LANG=fr_FR.utf8 midori

As a general rule, your localization should be based off of the
current state of the git repository.

Some strings have comments, starting with 'i18n', which are meant
to describe the role of a string to translators.
Please don't hesitate to ask for additional descriptive comments
for any unclear strings that you are uncertain about.
