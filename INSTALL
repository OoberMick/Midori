+++ Installing Midori +++

Building and installing Midori is straightforward.

Make sure you have Python 2.4 or higher installed.

Change to the Midori folder on your hard disk in a terminal.

Run './waf configure'

Run './waf build'

You can now run Midori from _build_/default/midori

You can install it with './waf install'

For further options run './waf --help'

+++ The alternative +++

Alternatively, autotools build files are available.

If you checked out from the repository, make sure
you have *libtool* and *intltool* installed.
Then run './autogen.sh'.

Run './configure'

Run 'make'

The usual autotools way works here, please refer to
according documentation in case of questions.
