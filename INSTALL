+++ Installing Midori +++

Building and installing Midori is straightforward.

Make sure you have Python 2.4 or higher installed.

Change to the Midori folder on your hard disk in a terminal.

Run './waf configure'

Run './waf build'

You can now run Midori from _build_/default/midori

You can install it with './waf install'

For further options run './waf --help'

+++ Debugging Midori +++

Run './waf configure -d debug' from the Midori folder.

Run './waf build'

Midori is now built with debugging symbols.

Make sure you have installed 'gdb', the GNU Debugger.

Run Midori as 'gdb _build_/default/midori'.

Try to reproduce a crash that you experienced earlier,
this time Midori will freeze at the point of the crash.
Switch to your terminal, type bt ('backtrace') and hit Return.
What you obtained now is a backtrace that should include
function names and line numbers.

For further information a tutorial for gdb and
reading up on how you can install debugging
symbols for libraries used by Midori are recommended.
